=================

interact with a variety of cryptographic hashing and encrypting methods.

## Why?

I need to do a demonstration of cryptography making use of linear algebra operations like matrix multiplication and to show the use of cryptography in the real world. 

## How?

Alot of these algorithms __are not my own work__ and instead come from [https://github.com/Omar-Salem/Classical-Encryption-Techniques](https://github.com/Omar-Salem/Classical-Encryption-Techniques) and [https://github.com/shawnmclean/SimpleCrypto.net](https://github.com/shawnmclean/SimpleCrypto.net).

The gui i've written is a windows form c# app for easy interaction.
